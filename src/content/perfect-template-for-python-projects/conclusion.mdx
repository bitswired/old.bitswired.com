## Bonus: VSCode Integration

If you are using VSCode, there is an awesome Python language server called **Pylance**. It will
statically check your code as you type, improve code clarity with enhanced colorization. I encourage
you to enable this feature for all your projects. You can control the level of severity for the type
checking, so you can adopt it progressively. It will catch tons of potential errors in your code
just by checking the types.

Also, for all the tools mentioned before, Mypy, Black, Isort, and Flake8, there are **plugins**
available in the VSCode marketplace.

Finally, to **integrate Poetry and VScode smoothly**, you need to tell VSCode the location of your
Python interpreter. Since Poetry manages it for you, run `poetry run which python` to get the
absolute path. Then in VSCode press Ctrl+P, type Select Python interpreter, and put the path.

## The Best Python Template To Start

Implementing all these good practices can feel too demanding especially if you are a beginner.
However, I encourage you to apply these good practices as **early** as possible in your coding
habits. It will overall make you a better coder, produce better quality code, and avoid
easy-to-catch pitfalls and bugs. Even for an advanced programmer, it can be cumbersome to do it
again and again for every project.

_Setting up these tools is not the most exciting part, but a necessary step toward success._

So I've made your life easier! I created a [GitHub template repository][github repo] addressing all
the issues. It's **easy to use**, when you create a new Python project, start it from my GitHub
template. You will only have to run poetry install to get all the dev dependencies required for the
tooling: **linting**, **formatting**, **type checking**. You will also have **poetry** to handle
your dependencies and **be ready to ship high-quality code in no time!** Check it out.
