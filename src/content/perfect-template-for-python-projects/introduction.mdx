**TLDR** - _Python is a great language with a lot of libraries available. From gaming to artificial
intelligence, even backend or automation. There is one main catch, the lack of structure and easy
mess due to the dynamic types. In this article, I identify all these problems and give you a
solution for each. Finally, I share with you a Github template repository to **start your new Python
projects on the right foot, and ship high-quality code in no time**!_

## Introduction

Working as a machine learning engineer, Python is one of my daily tools. It's an expressive
language, fast to write and it has one of the richest ecosystems, not to mention that most of the
tools to build artificial intelligence are available in Python. However, I would identifyÂ 2 main
drawbacks which can undermine your productivity and code robustness: the **lack of structure**
(dynamic types) and the **lack of built-in code quality tools**.
