## Issue 3: Packaging

### Problem

Awesome, you have a project ready to be packaged and published to pipy! But wait, you first need to
get it publish-ready and go through a list of steps that can be cumbersome ([see here][packaging]).

### Solution

Again poetry helps us there. It's super simple to build your package and publish it. You mainly have
2 commands to use: `poetry build` and `poetry publish`. Never be afraid to publish your package.
