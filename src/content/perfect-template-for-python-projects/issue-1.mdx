## Issue #1: Dependency Management

### Problem

Installing third-party libraries is an essential step in any programming project. But it's not
enough. It should be possible to version control the library you use and install the project with
all its dependencies on any computer. You also want isolation to avoid mixing dependencies between
different projects. Indeed if you have different projects depending on the same library but with a
different version, you don't want them to conflict with each other.

The standard way to tackle these problems in Python are **Pypi** (to install packages) and **virtual
environments** (for isolation). The typical workflow is:

1. You create a folder for your project
2. Create a virtual environment
3. Install dependencies with pip
4. Store the dependencies list in a file, `requirements.txt` using `pip freeze`

This provides you:

- **Isolation**: packages installed in the virtual environment are isolated from the rest of the
  system
- **Reproducibility (somehow)**: you can reinstall all the dependencies when you download the
  project, but you are not guaranteed to reach the same state at another point in time

2 problems remain:

- **Dependency mix**: you get a `requirements.txt` file mixed with your dependencies as well as
  packages required by these dependencies. It's a mess to track easily the packages you really
  depend on
- **Week reproducibility**: you are not guaranteed to reach the same project dependencies state if
  you reinstall your project later because `pip freeze` does not lock dependencies

### Solution

Use another package manager: [Poetry][poetry]. It's a modern package manager and builder. It's
really simple from a utilization point. All you need to provide is one file: the `pyproject.toml`
file. It solves the 2 problems mentioned above.

- **Clean dependencies**: in your `pyproject.toml` file you only specify the direct dependency for
  your project. It will never get mixed with dependency from other packages
- **Strong reproducibility**: poetry introduces a **lock file** `poetry.lock` to your project. In
  this file, all dependencies are locked to the version resolved at the installation. You are
  guaranteed to have the same dependency state for your project whenever you're installing it
